# GIS_Learning
This is my first repository. I create it for learning how to use Git and shareing my experience in learning GIS.
I mainly study python, JavaScript and Openlayers at present.
Sharing a quote I like very much:
> The gene of geography is everywhere, the value of geographical science is everywhere, and the consciousness of geographical thinking is everywhere.
> 地理的基因无处不在，地理科学的价值无处不在，地理思维的自觉无处不在。
